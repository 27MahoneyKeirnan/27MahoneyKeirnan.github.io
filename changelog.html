        <p>Welcome! I hope you've had a frantically fizzy day!</p>
        
        <h1>Changelog:</h1>
        <p>Added placeholder text, then settled on making a website about lithobiomorpha. Image and Introduction complete. (8/15/23)</p>
        <p>Grammatical corrections, added more information and completed citations. (8/16/23)</p>
        <p>Finally changed background from white to a lovely green! Added more information and am now smiling ear-to-ear because we
           have a favicon now!!! :D By the way the favicon is the little image that appears on the tab. It's a purple lithobiomorpha
           in front of a stone (because they're stone centipedes) which resides in a black circle. I plan to change the font tomorrow!
           Anyways I'll do some grammatical corrections and start my about the author. Stay safe! (8/17/23)</p>
        <p>I have abandoned the font change idea due to time constraints. I may come back to that later, but for now its priority has
            been greatly reduced. The majority of the site's information has been relocated into seperate files, using a centered menu
            bar at the top to send you from page to page. Also, if you would like to see the sources, please see the header for links
            to the "Home." Additionally, a quiz has been added, so now you can select your favorite order of the class Chilopoda! I know
            that there aren't too many options right now, but I will update it as more centipedes are added to the site. In case your
            favorite centipede isn't listed, you can simply choose other and type it in. Don't forget to click submit! (8/18/23)</p>
            <p>No weekend updates o.O</p>
        <p>Added "All of the above" option for the form. Changed headers for the centipede sites. The original form that had been added
            to this site has proved to be very complicated. As of now, nothing works on that form. In the meantime, an experimental form
            has been included under the "Stone Centipedes" or "Lithobiomorpha." (8/21/23)</p>
        <p>The "other" choice has been removed due to technical difficulties. Other than that, I made minor grammatical changes, shoved
            sources to the bottom, updated yesterday's Changelog (I had forgotten to yesterday) and fixed the quiz in the "Home" page.
            And I apologize in advance if I ever use "Main" instead of "Home," it's just that it was recently changed and I am having a
            hard time keeping track of the new titles. Reminder for future self: WATER MARVIN. Marvin is a succulent plant, by the way.
            I also added Scolopendromorpha and Craterostigmomorpha to the site! (8/22/23)</p>
        <p>Marvin was in fact watered yesterday! :D Today will be pretty underwhelming, with mainly grammatical corrections throughout
           the cite's files. After today, it should be complete! I also added a new option for the form in "Home." Moved changelog and
           sources! I also relocated more of the information in index.html to other files. Updated tab name. Added image. Now for some
           news. There will not be a changelog update tomorrow. Farewell, User. Until we meet again, of course! (8/23/23)</p>
        <p>I replaced the Lithobiomorpha image because I wasn't sure if the previous one was a stone centipede. I also added a colon to
            Sources. Futher more, I changed the choice of "Why? That's goofy." to "Dang okay." in the "Home" form and I added a
            "pronounced ___" to the headers of the centipede information pages so you can say Lithobiomorpha, Geophilamorpha,
            Scutigeromorpha, Scolopendromorpha, Craterostigmomorpha, and Chilopoda with confidence! And- *joke* Connection terminated.
            I'm sorry to interrupt you, User, if you still even remember that name, But I'm afraid you've been misinformed. There will
            be no more changelog updates from now on, despite what the About the Author said. However, there was indeed some truth to
            those statements, at least for the time being. You have been called here, into a labyrinth of links and URLs, misdirection
            and misfortune. A labyrinth with no exit (except for control w), a maze with no prize. (except for some sweet information on
            the five orders of the class Chilopoda of course!) Your lust for information on centipedes has driven you in endless circles,
            chasing the cries of entomologists in some unseen chamber, always seeming so near, yet somehow out of reach, but you will
            never find them. None of you will. This is where your story ends on this site. And to you, my brave User, who somehow found
            this site not intended for you, although there was a way out planned for you, I have a feeling that's not what you want. I
            have a feeling that you are right where you want to be. I am remaining as well. I am nearby. This place will not be
            remembered, and the memory of everything that started this can finally begin to fade away. As the agony of every tragedy
            should. And to you centipedes trapped in the corridors, be still and give up your spirits. They don't belong to you. For most
            of you, I believe there is peace and perhaps more waiting for you after the smoke clears. Although, for one of you, the
            darkest pit of Ohio has opened to swallow you whole, so don't keep Scolopendromorpha waiting, old friend. My sweet
            Geophilamorpha, if you can hear me, I knew you would return as well. It's in your nature to live in the underground. I'm
            sorry that on that day, the day you were shut out and left to die, no one was there to lift you up into their legs the way
            you lifted others into yours, and then, what became of you. I should have known you wouldn't be content to disappear, not my
            Geophilamorpha. I couldn't save you then, so let me save you now. It's time to rest - for you, and for those you have
            carried in your legs. This ends for all of us. End communication. So that's that. I had too much time on my hands. Well, this
            is my actual farewell. I do not believe there will be anotehr addition to the changelog. Good luck! (8/25/23)</p>
