            <h1>Above lies an image of the order known as Craterostigmomorpha."</h1>
        <p>Craterostigmomorpha is the most geographically restricted and least diverse order of Chilopoda. It comprises just one genus,
           one family, and two described species.
        </p>

        <h1>Growth:</h1>
        <p>Females will lay around 44-77 eggs in a clutch inside a crevice of a damp log or in the soil. They will stop eating and
           will instead coil themselves around the eggs. They will also "groom" the eggs by removing fungi. The hatchlings will be
           born with 12 legs, adding the three others in a single molt. It it difficult to distinguish sex without examining their
           reproductive biology.</p>
        
            <h1>Fast Facts:</h1>
        <p>-They move surprisingly quickly on their 15 pairs of legs, with one pair of many-jointed antennae armed with
            jawlike poison claws in front of the head.</p>
        <p>-One species resides in Tasmania while the other dwells in New Zealand</p>
        <p>-They can grow up to 50 millimeters in length</p>
        <p>-They likely consume small soft-bodied arthropods and sometimes termites</p>
        <p>-Greenish-brown in color, with three dark dorsal stripes and many striped legs</p>
        
            <h1>How do they hunt prey?</h1>
        <p>In captivity, they have been seen using their poison claws to extract termites from crevices in wood before eating them.</p>
