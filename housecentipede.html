            <h1>Above lies an image of the order known as Scutigeromorpha, or a "house centipede."</h1>
        <p>House centipedes can live their entire lives in a human home, and primarily settle in places with water, such as bathrooms
           and basements. They are considered by many to be the most beneficial that dwell in human homes, primarily because of their
           diet of household pests</p>

        <h1>Growth:</h1>
        <p>Scutigeromorpha, along with stone centipedes, (Lithbiomorpha) will begin their lives with as few as 4 pairs of legs, but
           will gain pairs with each molt until they reach full maturity. The common stone centipede can live as long as three years.
           That's a lot of molting! No wonder they're so fast! House centipedes will lay about 63 eggs in spring, and the hatchlings (living
           somewhere from 3-7 years depending on the conditions of their environment)</p>
        
            <h1>Fast Facts:</h1>
        <p>-They prefer cool, damp spaces</p>
        <p>-They move surprisingly quickly on their 15 pairs of legs (when mature), with one pair of many-jointed antennae armed with
            jawlike venomous claws not far behind the head.</p>
        <p>-Their legs are very long compared to other centipedes. The final two pairs, however, are the longest, and are used in mating
            and the capture of prey</p>
        <p>-Originated in the Medittaranean, it now live sin many human homes throughout the world, hence the nickname "house centipede"</p>
        <p>-They are about 25 millimeters in length</p>
        <p>-They eat small insects such as cockroaches, bedbugs, termites, silverfish, and even spiders. They are insectivores</p>
        <p>-Yellow-gray in color, with three dark dorsal stripes and many striped legs</p>
        <p>-Their legs are delicate while their bodies are very rigid</p>
        <p>-They have well-developed eyes</p>
        <p>-They can detach legs that are being held down, distracting the predator with a still-moving limb</p>
