            <h1>Above lies an image of the order known as Scutigeromorpha, or a "house centipede."</h1>
            According to the authors of Britannica,
            "They, like the house centipedes, run with the body held straight and are the fastest moving centipedes."</p>

        <h1>Growth:</h1>
        <p>Scutigeromorpha, along with stone centipedes, (Lithbiomorpha) will begin their lives with as few as 14 pairs of legs, but
           will gain pairs with each molt until they reach full maturity. The common stone centipede can live as long as three years.
           That's a lot of molting! No wonder they're so fast!</p>
        
            <h1>Fast Facts:</h1>
        <p>-They move quickly on their 15 pairs of legs (depending on their age and molting), with one pair of many-jointed antennae armed with
            jawlike venomous claws not far behind the head. However, centipedes are unable to have 100 legs, as the amount of pairs
            of legs that they have will always be odd</p>
        <p>-Their legs are very long compared to other centipedes. The final two pairs, however, are the
            longest, and are used in mating and the capture of prey</p>
        <p>-There are over __ known species in Australia, and about ___ in Europe</p>
        <p>-They are about 25 millimeters in length</p>
        <p>-They eat fungal spores, decaying plants, and the soft parts of small insects, slaters and spiders. They are omnivores</p>
        <p>-They have short, striped bodies</p>
        <p>-Their bodies contain roughly 15-18 segments with one pair of legs per segment</p>
        <p>-Their heads are heart-shaped, with a distinctive ridge on each side </p>
        
            <h1>How do they hunt prey?</h1>
        <p>"Stone centipedes capture prey with their poison claws, and cut up food with...[their]...mandibles. The stout poison claws are
            adapted for dealing with prey in the confined spaces. Some species are regarded as ambush predators, rather than hunters,
            and cannibalism is common. They have a wide variety of prey items including soft-bodied arthropods, worms, molluscs,
            spiders and nematodes." (“Key to Australian Freshwater and Terrestrial Invertebrates.” Order Spirobolida, keys.lucidcentral.org/keys/v3/TFI/start%20key/key/myriapoda%20key/Media/HTML/Spirobolida.html. Accessed 15 Aug. 2023.)</p>
