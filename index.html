            <h1>Above lies an image of the order known as lithobiomorpha, or a "stone centipede."</h1>
            According to
            [“Centipede.” Encyclopædia Britannica, 7 July 2023, www.britannica.com/animal/centipede. 
            “Centipede.” Encyclopædia Britannica, 7 July 2023, www.britannica.com/animal/centipede.

            "They, like the house centipedes, run with the body held straight and are the fastest moving centipedes." Centipedes, of the
            class Chilopoda, any of various long, many-segmented predaceous arthropods, with
            flattened bodies. Each of the segments of the centipede (minus the hindmost) bears a single pair of legs. During the day,
            these creatures will hide under bark, stones, or any other objects they can skitter underneath. This is because they
            prefer damp habitats. At night, however, they roam the lands in a hunt for small invertebrates.</p>
        <p>
            Fast Facts:</p>
        <p>-They move quickly on their legs, which may contain 14-177 pairs, with one pair of many-jointed antennae armed with
            jaw-like venomus claws not far behind the head. However, Centipedes are unable to have 100 legs, as the amount of pairs
            of legs that they have will always be odd</p>
        <p>-The legs grow longer at the back, while they are rather short towards the front. The final two pairs, however, are the
            longest, and are used in mating and the capture of prey</p>
        <p>-There are over 20 known species in Australia, and about 500 in Europe</p>
        <p>-They can range from 4-40 millimeters in length</p>
        <p>-They eat fungal spores, decaying plants, and the soft parts of small insects, slaters and spiders. They are omnivores</p>
        <p>-They can be purple-ish or red-brown in color</p>
        <p>-Their bodies contain roughly 15-18 segments with one pair of legs per segment. Up to two centimeters in length</p>
        <p>-Their heads are heart-shaped, with a distinctive ridge on each side </p>
        <p>
            How do they hunt prey?
            "Stone centipedes capture prey with their poison claws, and cut up food with...[their]...mandibles. The stout poison claws are
            adapted for dealing with prey in the confined spaces. Some species are regarded as ambush predators, rather than hunters,
            and cannibalism is common. They have a wide variety of prey items including soft-bodied arthropods, worms, molluscs,
            spiders and nematodes." (“Key to Australian Freshwater and Terrestrial Invertebrates.” Order Spirobolida, keys.lucidcentral.org/keys/v3/TFI/start%20key/key/myriapoda%20key/Media/HTML/Spirobolida.html. Accessed 15 Aug. 2023.)</p>
