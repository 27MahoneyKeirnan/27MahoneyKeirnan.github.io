            <h1>Above lies an image of the order known as lithobiomorpha, or a "stone centipede."</h1>
            According to the authors of Britannica,
            "They, like the house centipedes, run with the body held straight and are the fastest moving centipedes." Centipedes, of the
            class Chilopoda, are any of various long, many-segmented predaceous arthropods, with
            flattened bodies. Each of the segments of the centipede (minus the hindmost) bears a single pair of legs. During the day,
            these creatures will hide under bark, stones, or any other objects they can skitter underneath. This is because they
            prefer damp habitats. At night, however, they roam the lands in a hunt for small invertebrates.</p>

        <h1>Growth:</h1>
        <p>Lithobiomorpha, along with house centipedes, (Scutigeromorpha) will begin their lives with as few as 14 pairs of legs, but
           will gain pairs with each molt until they reach full maturity. The common stone centipede can live as long as three years.
           That's a lot of molting! No wonder they're so fast!</p>
        
            <h1>Fast Facts:</h1>
        <p>-They move quickly on their 14-177 pairs of legs (depending on their age and molting), with one pair of many-jointed antennae armed with
            jawlike venomous claws not far behind the head. However, centipedes are unable to have 100 legs, as the amount of pairs
            of legs that they have will always be odd</p>
        <p>-The legs grow longer at the back, while they are rather short towards the front. The final two pairs, however, are the
            longest, and are used in mating and the capture of prey</p>
        <p>-There are over 20 known species in Australia, and about 500 in Europe</p>
        <p>-They can range from 4-40 millimeters in length</p>
        <p>-They eat fungal spores, decaying plants, and the soft parts of small insects, slaters and spiders. They are omnivores</p>
        <p>-They can be purple-ish or red-brown in color</p>
        <p>-Their bodies contain roughly 15-18 segments with one pair of legs per segment</p>
        <p>-Their heads are heart-shaped, with a distinctive ridge on each side </p>
        
            <h1>How do they hunt prey?</h1>
        <p>"Stone centipedes capture prey with their poison claws, and cut up food with...[their]...mandibles. The stout poison claws are
            adapted for dealing with prey in the confined spaces. Some species are regarded as ambush predators, rather than hunters,
            and cannibalism is common. They have a wide variety of prey items including soft-bodied arthropods, worms, molluscs,
            spiders and nematodes." (“Key to Australian Freshwater and Terrestrial Invertebrates.” Order Spirobolida, keys.lucidcentral.org/keys/v3/TFI/start%20key/key/myriapoda%20key/Media/HTML/Spirobolida.html. Accessed 15 Aug. 2023.)</p>
            
            <h1>What role do they play in the environment?</h1>
        <p>Both centipedes and millipedes can be grouped into the term "myriapods." You may be asking yourself, "Why does this creature
           exist? Of what purpose does it serve?" Well, fret not my friend, as the answers to these questions will be promptly answered.
           They play a key part in the balancing of forest ecosystems. Plus, because they appear early in the geological timeline,
           haven't evolved much, are extremely dependent on moisture and shelter consistency, not fans of seawater, and have limited
           migration, they are important indicators of land-water relations.

        <h1>About the Author:</h1>
        <p>I suppose my name is in the URL, so I guess I'm not revealing it by saying it's Keirnan Mahoney. That's all the information
           I'll be giving about myself here, other than the fact that I was born in the Northwest of the United States. I'm kind of new
           to this whole GitHub thing so bear with me. However, there will be daily updates to the changelog for about another week. I
           believe that by then, I will have made a site of acceptable quality and visual appearance. I may start updating after that,
           but it depends what happens. Well, thank you for reading, User. Have a good one!
        </p>
        <h1>Changelog:</h1>
        <p>Added placeholder text, then settled on making a website about lithobiomporpha. Image and Introduction complete. (8/15/23)</p>
        <p>Grammatical corrections, added more information and completed citations. (8/16/23)</p>
        <p>Finally changed background from white to a lovely green! Added more information and am now smiling ear-to-ear because we
           have a favicon now!!! :D By the way the favicon is the little image that appears on the tab. It's a purple lithobiomorpha
           in front of a stone (because they're stone centipedes) which resides in a black circle. I plan to change the font tomorrow!
           Anyways I'll do some grammatical corrections and start my about the author. Stay safe! (8/17/23)
