        <h1>An insight into the orders of centipedes in our world!</h1>

            <h1>Above lies an image of a centipede.</h1>
        <p>According to the authors of Britannica,
           Centipedes, of the class Chilopoda, are any of various long, many-segmented predaceous arthropods, with flattened bodies.
           Each of the segments of the centipede (minus the hindmost) bears a single pair of legs. During the day, these creatures will
           hide under bark, stones, or any other objects they can skitter underneath. This is because they prefer damp habitats.
           At night, however, they roam the lands in a hunt for small invertebrates. Fun fact: centipedes are unable to have 100 legs,
           as the amount of pairs of legs that they have will always be odd</p>
        
        <h1>What role do they play in the environment?</h1>
        <p>Both centipedes and millipedes can be grouped into the term "myriapods." You may be asking yourself, "Why does this creature
           exist? Of what purpose does it serve?" Well, fret not my friend, as the answers to these questions will be promptly answered.
           They play a key part in the balancing of forest ecosystems. Plus, because they appear early in the geological timeline,
           haven't evolved much, are extremely dependent on moisture and shelter consistency, not fans of seawater, and have limited
           migration, they are important indicators of land-water relations.</p>

        <h1>About the Author:</h1>
        <p>I suppose my name is in the URL, so I guess I'm not revealing any additional information about myself by saying it's Keirnan
            Mahoney. That's all of the 
           I'll be giving about myself here, other than the fact that I was born in the Northwest of the United States. I'm kind of new
           to this whole GitHub thing so bear with me. However, there will be daily updates to the changelog for about another week. I
           believe that by then, I will have made a site of acceptable quality and visual appearance. I may start updating after that,
           but it depends what happens. Well, thank you for reading, User. Have a good one!</p>

        <h1>Changelog:</h1>
        <p>Added placeholder text, then settled on making a website about lithobiomorpha. Image and Introduction complete. (8/15/23)</p>
        <p>Grammatical corrections, added more information and completed citations. (8/16/23)</p>
        <p>Finally changed background from white to a lovely green! Added more information and am now smiling ear-to-ear because we
           have a favicon now!!! :D By the way the favicon is the little image that appears on the tab. It's a purple lithobiomorpha
           in front of a stone (because they're stone centipedes) which resides in a black circle. I plan to change the font tomorrow!
           Anyways I'll do some grammatical corrections and start my about the author. Stay safe! (8/17/23)</p>
        <p>Relocated the majority of the site's information into seperate files, using a menu in the top left to send you from page to
            page. Also, if you would like tos ee the sources, links have been povided to the Home from the Sources section.
            Additionally, a quiz has been added, so now you can select your favorite centipede! I know that there aren't too many right
            now, but I will update it as more centipedes are added to the site. In case your favorite centipede isn't listed, you can
            simply choose other and type it in. Don't forget to click submit! (8/18/23)</p>
        <p>Added "All of the above" option for the form. Changed headers for the centipede sites. The original form that had been added
            to this site has proved to be very complicated. As of now, nothing works on that form. In the meantime, an experimental form
            has been included under the "Stone Centipedes" or "Lithobiomorpha."(8/21/23)</p>
        <p>Minor grammatical changes, shoved sources to the bottom, updated Changelog (I had forgotten to yesterday) and fixed the quiz
            in the Home page. And I apologize in advance if I ever use "Main" instead of "Home," it's just that it was recently changed
            and I am having a hard time keeping track of the new titles. Reminder for future self: WATER MARVIN. Marvin is a succulent
            plant, by the way. I also added Scolopendromorpha and Craterostigmomorpha to the site! (8/22/23)</p>
