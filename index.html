            <h1>Above lies an image of a centipede.</h1>
            According to the authors of Britannica,
            Centipedes, of the class Chilopoda, are any of various long, many-segmented predaceous arthropods, with flattened bodies.
            Each of the segments of the centipede (minus the hindmost) bears a single pair of legs. During the day, these creatures will
            hide under bark, stones, or any other objects they can skitter underneath. This is because they prefer damp habitats.
            At night, however, they roam the lands in a hunt for small invertebrates.</p>

        <h1>Growth:</h1>
        <p>Lithobiomorpha, along with house centipedes, (Scutigeromorpha) will begin their lives with as few as 14 pairs of legs, but
           will gain pairs with each molt until they reach full maturity. The common stone centipede can live as long as three years.
           That's a lot of molting! No wonder they're so fast!</p>
        
        <h1>What role do they play in the environment?</h1>
        <p>Both centipedes and millipedes can be grouped into the term "myriapods." You may be asking yourself, "Why does this creature
           exist? Of what purpose does it serve?" Well, fret not my friend, as the answers to these questions will be promptly answered.
           They play a key part in the balancing of forest ecosystems. Plus, because they appear early in the geological timeline,
           haven't evolved much, are extremely dependent on moisture and shelter consistency, not fans of seawater, and have limited
           migration, they are important indicators of land-water relations.

        <h1>About the Author:</h1>
        <p>I suppose my name is in the URL, so I guess I'm not revealing it by saying it's Keirnan Mahoney. That's all the information
           I'll be giving about myself here, other than the fact that I was born in the Northwest of the United States. I'm kind of new
           to this whole GitHub thing so bear with me. However, there will be daily updates to the changelog for about another week. I
           believe that by then, I will have made a site of acceptable quality and visual appearance. I may start updating after that,
           but it depends what happens. Well, thank you for reading, User. Have a good one!</p>

        <h1>Changelog:</h1>
        <p>Added placeholder text, then settled on making a website about lithobiomporpha. Image and Introduction complete. (8/15/23)</p>
        <p>Grammatical corrections, added more information and completed citations. (8/16/23)</p>
        <p>Finally changed background from white to a lovely green! Added more information and am now smiling ear-to-ear because we
           have a favicon now!!! :D By the way the favicon is the little image that appears on the tab. It's a purple lithobiomorpha
           in front of a stone (because they're stone centipedes) which resides in a black circle. I plan to change the font tomorrow!
           Anyways I'll do some grammatical corrections and start my about the author. Stay safe! (8/17/23)</p>
        <p>Relocated the majority of the site's information into seperate files. (8/18/23)
