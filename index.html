            <h1>Above lies an image of a centipede.</h1>
        <p>According to the authors of Britannica,
           Centipedes, of the class Chilopoda, are any of various long, many-segmented predaceous arthropods, with flattened bodies.
           Each of the segments of the centipede (minus the hindmost) bears a single pair of legs. During the day, these creatures will
           hide under bark, stones, or any other objects they can skitter underneath. This is because they prefer damp habitats.
           At night, however, they roam the lands in a hunt for small invertebrates. Fun fact: centipedes are unable to have 100 legs,
           as the amount of pairs of legs that they have will always be odd!</p>
        
        <h1>What role do they play in the environment?</h1>
        <p>Both centipedes and millipedes can be grouped into the term "myriapods." You may be asking yourself, "Why does this creature
           exist? Of what purpose does it serve?" Well, fret not my friend, as the answers to these questions will be promptly answered.
           They play a key part in the balancing of forest ecosystems. And, because they appear early in the geological
           timeline, haven't evolved much, are extremely dependent on moisture and shelter consistency, not fans of seawater, and have
           limited migration, they are important indicators of land-water relations.</p>

        <h1>About the Author:</h1>
        <p>I suppose my name is in the URL, so I suppose I'm not revealing any additional information about myself by saying it's Keirnan
           Mahoney. That's all of the details I'll be giving about myself here, other than the fact that I was born in the Northwest
           of the United States. I'm kind of new to this whole GitHub thing so bear with me. However, there will be daily updates to
           the changelog up until the 25th. I believe that by then, I will have made a site of acceptable quality and visual appearance.
           I may start updating after that, but it depends what happens. Well, thank you for reading, User. Have a good one!</p>
