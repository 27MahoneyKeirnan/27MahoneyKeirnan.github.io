        <p>Above you will find an image of a member of the species known as lithobiomorpha, or "stone centipedes." According to
            [cite encyclopedia brittanica], "They, like the house centipedes, run with the body held straight and are the fastest
            moving centipedes." Centipedes, of the class Chilopoda, any of various long, many-segmented predaceous arthropods, with
            flattened bodies. Each of the segments of the centipede (minus the hindmost) bears a single pair of legs. During the day,
            these creatures will hide under bark, stones, or any other objects they can skitter underneath. This is because they
            prefer damp habitats. At night, however, they roam the lands in a hunt for small invertebrates.
