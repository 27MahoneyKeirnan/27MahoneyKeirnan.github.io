        <h1>A peek at Scolopendromorpha!</h1>

            <h1>Above lies an image of the order known as Scolopendromorpha</h1>
            Scolopendrids are the largest and most predatory of centipedes. They are the most important in the resarch of medicine and
            toxicology due to how toxic their venom is. They are also present in the main studies of bites inflicted upon humans.</p>

        <h1>Growth:</h1>
        <p>When ready, a pair of centipedes will tap each other on the head with their antennae to begin mating. After some events I
           won't go into, the female digs a 7-10 cm hole in the soil, in which she will lay an oval-shaped cluster of 9-66 eggs. This
           hole is usually under a rock. The eggs are held together by a gelatinous secretion. The newborn centipedes will resemble
           their mature counterparts, merely reduced in size. They will also not have their reproductive systems at this time. It will
           take 10 molts for the centipedes to grow and develop. In some species, the young will eat their mother.</p>
        
            <h1>Fast Facts:</h1>
        <p>-They move quickly on their 21 or 23 pairs of legs, which rest on their 25 or 27 segments. Their first pair of legs has been
            modified to house a pair of powerful poison claws. The last pair of legs is likely used to pinch prey</p>
        <p>-There are 600 known species, with an estimated 200 more around the globe</p>
        <p>-In terms of length, they include the largest centipede, 𝘚𝘤𝘰𝘭𝘰𝘱𝘦𝘯𝘥𝘳𝘢 𝘨𝘪𝘨𝘢𝘯𝘵𝘦𝘢, (30 cm)</p>
        <p>-They are strong and flexible creatures</p>
        <p>-Most species are blind or have four ocelli on either side of their heads</p>
        <p>-Scolopendrids, as well as geophilids, have very serpentine and slow movements</p>
        <p>-They can be red, orange, yellow, green, or blue. Depending on the species, they may also have darker markings</p>
        <p>-Their heads are rounded</p>
        
            <h1>How do they hunt prey?</h1>
        <p>"Scolopendrid centipedes are predatory arthropods and actively hunt their prey. However, when prey densities are high they
            can adopt a strategy that more closely resembles the sit-and-wait behaviour of other arthropods. The highly mobile antennae
            explore the area in front of the centipede in search of signs of prey. Prey items include most arthropods, however large
            specimens have been reported to hunt vertebrates such...[as]...reptiles, amphibians, small mammals, bats and birds.
            𝘚𝘤𝘰𝘭𝘰𝘱𝘦𝘯𝘥𝘳𝘢 𝘨𝘪𝘨𝘢𝘯𝘵𝘦𝘢, also known as the Amazonian giant centipede, is known to eat bats, catching them in midflight, as well
            as rodents and spiders. The centipede wraps itself around the prey, securing it with the enlarged hind legs, and biting with
            the poison claws. The venom is toxic to both mammals and insects, but does not appear to be strong enough to kill large
            animals quickly. Once paralyzed or killed, the prey is cut into smaller pieces with the mandibles and poison claws, which are
            then fed into the mouth. As well as being voracious predators, scolopendrid centipedes are also opportunistic and will take
            carrion when the opportunity is presented."(Key to Australian freshwater and terrestrial invertebrates)</p>
