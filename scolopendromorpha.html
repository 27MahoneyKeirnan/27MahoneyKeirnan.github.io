        <h1>A peek at Scolopendromorpha!</h1>

            <h1>Above lies an image of the order known as Scolopendromorpha</h1>
            Scolopendrids are the largest and most predatory of centipedes. They are the most important in the resarch of medicine and
            toxicology due to how toxic their venom is. They are also present in the main studies of bites inflicted upon humans.</p>

        <h1>Growth:</h1>
        <p>When ready, a pair of centipedes will tap each other on the head with their antennae to begin mating. After some events I
           won't go into, the female digs a 7-10 cm hole in the soil, in which she will lay an oval-shaped cluster of 9-66 eggs . This hole
           is usually under a rock. The eggs are held together by a gelatinous secretion.
        </p>
        
            <h1>Fast Facts:</h1>
        <p>-They move quickly on their 21 or 23 pairs of legs, which rest on their 25 or 27 segments. Their first pair of legs has been
            modified to house a pair of powerful poison claws. The last pair of legs is likely used to pinch prey</p>
        <p>-There are 600 known species, with an estimated 200 more around the globe</p>
        <p>-In terms of length, they include the largest centipede, *Scolopendra gigantea,* (30 cm)</p>
        <p>-They are strong and felxible creatures</p>
        <p>-They eat ___, ___, and ___</p>
        <p>-Most species are blind or have four ocelli on either side of their heads</p>
        <p>-Scolopendrids, as well as geophilids, have very serpentine and slow movements</p>
        <p>-They can be red, orange, yellow, green, or blue. Depending on the species, they may also have darker markings.</p>
        <p>-Their heads are rounded</p>
        
            <h1>How do they hunt prey?</h1>
        <p>Soil centipedes primarily consume earthworms (due to how easily the soil centiped's poison claws can penetrate the
            creature's body), but have been known to go after snails and small arthropods, too. However, soil centipedes are unable
            to subdue earthworms larger than themselves.
