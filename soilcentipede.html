            <h1>Above lies an image of the order known as Geophilamorpha, or a "soil centipede."</h1>
            According to the authors of Britannica,
            Soil centipedes are burrowers that expand and crontract their bodies (in a similar manner to earthworms) to dig into the
            ground. Unlike many other centipedes, this one is not as adapted for speed, rather taking the underground approach</p>

        <h1>Growth:</h1>
        <p>The mother centipede will guard the eggs after she has laid them in leaf litter or soil. The hatchlings will already have
           legs and segments, and will be able to reproduce in several molts.</p>
        
            <h1>Fast Facts:</h1>
        <p>-They move quickly on their 27-191 pairs of legs, which rest on their 33 segments. They also have stout legs in their
            anterior, which are used to widen their burrow. They too have the pair of many-jointed antennae armed with jawlike venomous
            claws not far behind the head. However, centipedes are unable to have 100 legs, as the amount of pairs of legs that they
            have will always be odd</p>
        <p>-Their legs are all relatively the same length, in contrast to many otehr centipedes, such as lithobiomorpha. The final
            two pairs, however, are longer, and are used in mating and the capture of prey</p>
        <p>-There are about 1,276 known species</p>
        <p>-They are very diverse, and can range from 5-200 millimeters in length. Some are fragile and thin, while others are larger
            and much more durable</p>
        <p>-They eat earthworms, snails, and small arthropods</p>
        <p>-They are blind</p>
        <p>-Scolopendrids, as well as geophiids, have very serpentine and slow movements</p>
        <p>-They are pale with yellow-tan heads, which resemble rectangles</p>
        <p>-They are also known as "earth centipedes" or "earth-lovers"</p>
        
            <h1>How do they hunt prey?</h1>
        <p>Soil centipedes primarily consume earthworms (due to how easily the soil centiped's poison claws can penetrate the
            creature's body), but have been known to go after snails and small arthropods, too. However, soil centipedes are unable
            to subdue earthworms larger than themselves.
