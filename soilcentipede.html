            <h1>Above lies an image of the order known as Geophilamorpha, or a "soil centipede."</h1>
            According to the authors of Britannica,
            Soil centipedes are burrowers that expand and crontract their bodies (in a similar manner to earthworms) to dig into the
            ground.</p>

        <h1>Growth:</h1>
        <p>Lithobiomorpha, along with house centipedes, (Scutigeromorpha) will begin their lives with as few as 14 pairs of legs, but
           will gain pairs with each molt until they reach full maturity. The common stone centipede can live as long as three years.
           That's a lot of molting! No wonder they're so fast!</p>
        
            <h1>Fast Facts:</h1>
        <p>-They move quickly on their 14-177 pairs of legs (depending on their age and molting), with one pair of many-jointed antennae armed with
            jawlike venomous claws not far behind the head. However, centipedes are unable to have 100 legs, as the amount of pairs
            of legs that they have will always be odd</p>
        <p>-The legs grow longer at the back, while they are rather short towards the front. The final two pairs, however, are the
            longest, and are used in mating and the capture of prey</p>
        <p>-There are over 20 known species in Australia, and about 500 in Europe</p>
        <p>-They can range from 4-40 millimeters in length</p>
        <p>-They eat fungal spores, decaying plants, and the soft parts of small insects, slaters and spiders. They are omnivores</p>
        <p>-They can be purple-ish or red-brown in color</p>
        <p>-Their bodies contain roughly 15-18 segments with one pair of legs per segment</p>
        <p>-Scolopendrids, as well as geophiids, have very serpentine and slow movements</p>
        
            <h1>How do they hunt prey?</h1>
        <p>"Stone centipedes capture prey with their poison claws, and cut up food with...[their]...mandibles. The stout poison claws are
            adapted for dealing with prey in the confined spaces. Some species are regarded as ambush predators, rather than hunters,
            and cannibalism is common. They have a wide variety of prey items including soft-bodied arthropods, worms, molluscs,
            spiders and nematodes." (“Key to Australian Freshwater and Terrestrial Invertebrates.” Order Spirobolida, keys.lucidcentral.org/keys/v3/TFI/start%20key/key/myriapoda%20key/Media/HTML/Spirobolida.html. Accessed 15 Aug. 2023.)</p>
