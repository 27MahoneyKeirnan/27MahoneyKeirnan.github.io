        <p>About Joanne SpencerI’ve always been passionate about animals which led me to a career in training and behaviour. As an animal professional I’m committed to improving relationships between people and animals to bring them more happiness. “House Centipede - Facts, Information &amp; Pictures.” Animal Corner, 4 Nov. 2022, animalcorner.org/animals/house-centipede/. </p>
        <p>And, that image at the bottom of the Scolopendromorpha page, the one of a centipede feeding on a grasshopper, belongs to a
           YouTube video uploaded by "NaidensInsects" so go check his channel out. I also tried to use images with watermarks because
           according to google, the images were being used by numerous sites, so it would be difficult to decipher who originally made
           it.</p>
